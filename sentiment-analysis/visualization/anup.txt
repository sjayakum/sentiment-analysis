For the Media: It is not possible to take calls from all media people. Pls come to my school at 5.30pm today. Wil talk. #PakistanVisitDenied
Pak High Commission shud know their own rules. #KarachiLitFest had given my name to authorities 1 month back &amp; have my name in every poster.
Didn't Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs red flag my name to Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi? Why hide facts deliberately?
Indian Govt welcomes Pakistan based writers, artists, actors etc. Pakistan Govt. bans entry of Indian actors. Why fear a free dialogue?
Has my visa been denied because I speak about India's rich tradition of tolerance or I am a Kashmiri Pandit who may expose Pak terror nexus?
Sad to have been denied visa on second time in a year. While around 17 people will participate in the Karachi Literature Festival as guests.
Have been informed that Pakistan MoFA has denied permission for my visa to participate in the Karachi Literature festival.
