A large area across Mwada, Telangana and Bidar/gulbarga in Ktaka, old nizam state, needs rain this year. Can't handle another drought.
Compared to other parts of M'tra, Marathwada lags behind. But compared to, let's say a Bundelkhand, still ahead. much much more needed.
Latur has seen incredible growth in last 20 years. Credit to late Vilasrao Deshmukh. But with 'growth' pressure on basic needs like water.
Good work being done by art of living volunteers in pushing for water conservation in Latur. Appreciate.
What strikes one through any drought prone area like Mwada is it's women who do hard work mostly. Met one who queues up at 2 am for water!

Hope Kollam doesn't become an occasion for political oneupmaship ahead of elections. This is a human tragedy. No Politics please. Agree?
Still no sign in Latur of the water train. Now we are told it will take another 24 hours! #groundzeromarathwada

An 8 on 10 'performance' by @PMOIndia ; he truly is a super public debater. Higher marks if he had stayed away from personal attacks.
@PMOIndia raises issue of how @OfficeOfRG tore a cabinet ordinance in public: bang on. Should never have been done by the Cong leader.
Too much kolaveri on all sides in parliament. Maybe, we need to take leaf from Vajpayee book? #indiaabovepolitics

good stuff by @rahulkanwal on Kanhaiya story. breaking now on @IndiaToday tv
go watch the story on air on @IndiaToday tv. and when you abuse, do it with class next time! https://t.co/yIehrphfsY
those who have already condemned Kanhaiya to be guilty based on false videos must be tried for sedition!! #mediatrial
video shows Kanhaiya saying azaadi from RSS, poverty; audio clipped to only use word 'azaadi': truly shocking. #fakevideo
shocker: breaking now on @IndiaToday tv video against Kanhaiya shown on 2 channels 'doctored'? audio from one source, video from another!!
Other big takeaway: BJP still party number one by some distance. @narendramodi neta number one. Warning signals in unkept promises

I guess on days like today I feel I was right: 2014 is an election that changed India.
So Rajeev Dhawan, one of the country's finest lawyers and his team, are called 'bahenchod' and 'Pakistan ke dalle' in court? Shame!
Will our big netas/their PR teams who tweet lullabies now tweet to condemn Patiala House violence. More importantly, will they act?
Ugly face of pseudo patriots on display in Patiala House. All in the name of Bharat Mata. Please don't insult my great country friends.

Don't forget, women journalists were targeted one day in December 1992 too. All in the name of 'nationalism'.
To pull a woman journalist by her hair, to abuse them, all in the name of 'motherland'? This is what pseudo patriotism is about my friends.
same channels that are silent today were also silent when Shiv Sena attacked IBN Lokmat office. Their outrage doesn't extend to their own?
With every passing day, the JNU episode confirms that patriotism is not the last, but first refuge of scoundrels.
Today I feel proud as a journalist for solidarity shown. Ashamed because there are those who do not speak up when journalists are attacked.
So 2 news channels boycott protests by journalists against attacks on fellow journalists. Time to name/shame them?

It's faintly amusing when corrupt politicians give sermons on desh Bhakti. real patriots are millions of Indians who do a hard day's work
This 'us' versus 'them' must end: let univ act against anti India sloganeers but stop looking at all dissent as anti national. Possible?

The worst thing in a JNU like situation is over-reaction. The best thing is to keep netas of all hues away from campuses. Agree?
@nikskhandelwal disagree with content of slogans, but don't see it as sedition. Else, next you will jail PDP members (BJP allies) under it!
Sedition is slapped on students who sloganeer, not against those who stash ill gotten gains in foreign accounts. Strange country?
Good point but if hate speech provokes violence clamp down on it. Violence is the touchstone.  https://t.co/mVNX1ef1N6
A colonial law like sedition needs to be struck off statute books. Prosecute for violence, not for sloganeering IMHO.

@sharmanagendar his apology well taken, but the act itself should never have happened.
Sadly, social media has contributed to this culture of violence: hate armies one day can easily transform into ink attackers the next.
And Delhi police needs to be seen to act swiftly next time: this was a security lapse and must be accepted as one.
And yes, Jarnail Singh of AAP who threw a slipper on @PChidambaram_IN must also be condemned. Bad precedent.
Shameful there are those who justify an ink attack on a public figure. Whether @ArvindKejriwal or a @SudheenKulkarni, this must stop.

The biggest  story of 2015 in my humble view at OTV meet in Bhubaneshwar: agrarian distress, a story we should have reported more often.
Which was the biggest story of 2015? All set to speak at OTV event in Bhubaneshwar. https://t.co/KfTuM4iIUb
Suprabhatam! Reached Bhubaneshwar at 4.30 am, air India hostess says welcome to raja bhoj airport in Bhopal! An AI story for the ages!
Minister on board AI flight to Bhopal, MP forest minister Sartaj Singh!
It's close to 1 am; neither Bhopal or Bhubaneshwar AI flts have left; dharna continues, this is India's national carrier!
Yes I would.  https://t.co/jUAdorBfcf

And now passengers of Bhopal and Bhubaneshwar fighting on who should board first! Only in India! https://t.co/0R9dSByMmK
Air India creates new history. Asks pilots to move from Bhubaneshwar flight to Bhopal flight because MD is rung up by judges on board!
Two judges and @DILIPtheCHERIAN on Bhopal flight force air India to get a back up crew to get plane to fly! Good luck! Only in India!
Air India cancels flight to Bhopal citing 'technical' problem: real reason: a pilot says duty time is over!!
Only Air India would probably delay a flight by four hours 15 minutes before you are to board! We are like that only I guess!
Destination Bhubaneshwar: delivering lectures at OTV summit and Bwar Lit fest tomw. Do come! Will take all your qs on media and more.

We now have both the present and former FMs on NH and GST on @IndiaToday TV. My job done: now it's for viewers to judge!
I have communicated our views on GST to Cong. Maybe Chidambaram is not aware; am only taking forward his bill #JaitleytoRajdeep
@arunjaitley tells me: ready for an open debate on NH case and political vendettas. The debate will embarrass the Cong' #JaitleytoRajdeep
Arun Jaitley tells me: NH is a matter between complainant, accused and courts. Why drag govt and parliament into this? #JaitleytoRajdeep
@arunjaitley tells me: congress is caught in a chakravyuha and don't know how to get out of it in NH case #JaitleytoRajdeep
@arunjaitley hits back: tells me which case was closed in NH and reopened? ED has nothing to do with ongoing case #JaitleytoRajdeep
And yet I will be abused on social media! ðŸ€ #chidambaramtorajdeep https://t.co/3nhse6hTA0
He wants to see the formal govt response, claims none has been received so far! #pctorajdeep  https://t.co/FtlOyyupnU
'Putting non profit company as major shareholder locks the properties of AJL.No one gets any benefit. So where is the 'deal'?: P Chidambaram
Exact quote of P Chidambaram on parliament logjam over NH case:what happens in parliament depends on the dynamics of the day' #pctorajdeep
@suchetadalal no clear answer to that.
Looks like zero loss/profit theory is back in NH case! Now we should wait to see what the courts say and get parliament to function? Agree?
Full interview with P Chidambaram on now on @IndiaToday TV. #pctorajdeep
Chidambaram tells me: Gandhis are not above the law, will be proven right. #pctorajdeep
I ask PC why is he not appearing in NH case for Gandhis: 'Kapil Sibal and @DrAMSinghvi are more competent' #pctorajdeep
Not a single Paisa of Assoc Journals has gone into any private hands of Young India; balance sheet is avail. #pctorajdeep
I cannot answer why party is blocking parliament on NH issue, I am not an MP: #pctorajdeep
Do not link GST to NH case: we are waiting for govt response to our proposals on GST: #pctorajdeep
We have still not received an answer as to why ED officer was changed on a private complaint in NH case: #pctorajdeep
Why was a closed case reopened and the ED officer removed? This leads to suspicion of vendetta: #pctorajdeep

And to think there were netas/journalists in Ayodhya on that day who were actually 'celebrating' the demolition. Many of them still around!

And December 6 1992 was a Sunday too! May this Sunday be a day of reflection and repentance.
December 6th changed Mumbai for me forever. Exposed the grime that lay under its bindaas spirit. Left it a city divided.
